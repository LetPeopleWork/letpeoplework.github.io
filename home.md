      [Lighthouse](https://lighthousepublicdemo.azurewebsites.net/) is a tool that creates probabilistic forecasts using Monte Carlo Simulations based on the data you have in your work tracking system (Jira or Azure DevOps).

      Start planning with confidence based on your team's actual performance instead of relying on estimates. With Lighthouse you can:
      * Create forecasts for projects, from initial planning to delivery
      * Define Milestones and see the likelihood of reaching them
      * Improve efficiency by skipping long estimation meetings
      * Get real-time data of your progress and continuously updated plans based on your teams' performance
