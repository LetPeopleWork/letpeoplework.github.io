      * Combines Flow Metrics Visualization and Forecasts in one tool
      * Allows you to easily regenerate forecasts and visualization once you've set it up

    title: "Peter Zylka-Greger"
    excerpt: |
      Hi, I'm Peter!
      
      For years I have been fortunate enough to work with teams all over the world. It is something that I thoroughly enjoy and that helped me to see what a great team is capable of achieving.
      
      But it also showed me that it is not just done by putting individuals into a group and mixing them with others. Having a variety of techniques, emotional intelligence and
      a good toolkit at hand are very helpful.
      
      I'm happy to be able to share some of these with you.

    title: "Why do we even care about all this?"
    excerpt: |
      It is getting harder and harder for us to focus on our work. Monotonous interactions and recurring meetings keep us busy as well as distracted from what should be our focus: delivering value to our customers.

      As we go on, more meetings are added to rectify the situation, more things are "high-priority" and even less gets done.

      The result? Frustrated team members, overwhelmed managers, angry stakeholders, and complaining customers.

      People want to contribute. People want to deliver value. People want to be part of something successful. We just need to let them work.

      We've seen what impact a change in the system can have on individuals, teams, as well as an organization as a whole.
      We'd like to support you in unleashing the full potential of your employees and teams.

  - image_path: /assets/Benji.png
    title: "Benjamin Huser-Berta"
    excerpt: |
      I'm Benjamin (but you can call me Benji). I'm a Software Engineer and a professional Scrum Master.

      In my work as a developer as well as an Agile Coach, I've experienced how teams are struggling. Being forced to spend time in meetings that are not bringing any value just because the process demands it. Not having time to support each other because the amount of work is overwhelming. Those are just a few things that make people lose their motivation and work dull and frustrating.

      I believe work can be creative and fun. I believe we can reduce those wasteful activities and create an environment where you can focus on delivering value instead of simply being busy. And I believe that you and your team can move in this direction as well, independent of your current environment and processes.

      I'd love to support you while moving in this direction.
